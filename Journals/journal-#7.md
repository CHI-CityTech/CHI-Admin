This week, I met with my professor for a total of 2 hours. I began working on the ranking system, evaluating each image and recording the results in a Google document. I then transferred this information to the website, carefully designing the text and image spacing to make the presentation visually appealing and easy for readers to navigate.

I spent 17 hours in total switching between the website and the document, observing and ranking each image, jotting down results and comments, tallying scores, and adjusting the website’s design to accommodate the data. Additionally, I added more context to the main page, giving viewers helpful information to navigate the website effectively. I edited the main page format to align links and descriptions better, enhancing the visual experience, which took about an hour.

I started working on the Claude ranking page and completed Prompt 1 in about 2 hours. The following day, I worked on Prompts 2 and 3, which took a total of 3 hours. I also began testing Grok 2, documenting my results and implementing them on the main page. While I’ve started ranking images from Grok, I haven’t yet added them to the website, which I plan to do soon.

In total, I spent **29 hours** on this week’s tasks.
