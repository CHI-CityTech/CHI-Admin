For my first task, I was assigned to do research and explore Google Sites to get a hang of using it. I learned a lot by watching YouTube video tutorials and reading the official documentation of Google Sites to understand how to use the tool in order to create a usable website. 

While I was practicing hands-on, I made my own website showcasing my portfolio. It took a lot of time adjusting the website's design, choosing the pictures, and gathering material needed for the website. Designing the website was really fun, and seeing my work all come together in a concise and usable website made the experience satisfying to navigate without having to code everything from scratch. 

Before this, I had to meet with the professor twice and familiarize myself with the project by reading documentation on other already-made websites. There were in-person meetings, but I wasn't able to attend because the emails would be sent out last minute. However, my advisor made sure to figure out a set time where we could all meet up. 

The biggest challenge I faced was designing the website to be as satisfying yet visually appealing as possible. In total, everything took about 10 hours.
