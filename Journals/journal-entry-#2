This week, I was assigned to design and find materials to implement into the project's official website. I met my advisor earlier in the week to discuss and review my previous work and talk about my tasks for this week. 

He assigned me tasks where I had to find AI image generator applications to experiment with, in order to help find the most effectively curated images for the website. Before that, I had to read the documentation for each sub-project to figure out what kind of image I wanted to represent it. 

It took me a while to figure out how to properly use each generator. I had to do a lot of trial and error in crafting prompts to curate the exact images I wanted. Additionally, I filled out forms for each generator I used, which included multiple questions to help specify how effective the generator was in generating accurate images with proper formatting. I also compared each generator to others.

To stay organized, I saved and categorized every image into a folder. Altogether, this work took about 12 hours this week.
