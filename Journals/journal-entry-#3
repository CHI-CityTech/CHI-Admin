Over the past weeks, I’ve worked on implementing subpages in the department website by adding images, creating different tabs, and placing the corresponding images on the subpages. For each subpage title, I linked it to pages describing potential future projects for viewers to read.

I’ve met with the professor weekly for about an hour to discuss my progress and address questions about the assignments. During this time, I had to redo the AI image testing using better prompts and a new account rather than my personal email, which I had mistakenly used earlier. This issue was clarified and resolved after meeting with the professor.

Overall, this work has taken about 22 hours.
