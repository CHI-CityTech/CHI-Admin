This week, I met with the professor for a few hours discussing the progress and 
findings of my tasks. I looked into a few more AI image generating websites and 
wrote down all the information from my testing. I created a subpage listing and 
detailing all of the results of the testing which helped set up a good view to 
compare each result. Iâ€™ve spent 14 hours in total this week.
