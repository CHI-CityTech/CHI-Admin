For this week, I tested an additional AI generator (as there are many out there) and 
added that to the document. I filled out the results on the form andwebsite. I 
implemented a pull-down tab/bar to showcase each detail from the results of the 
tests under each generator. I also added additional subpages for each prompt in the 
test for an additional way to compare and contrast results of the test. Met with the 
Professor for an hour to look over my tasks and assign new tasks. This in total had 
taken me 6 hours.
