For this week, I implemented additional information on the “AI Image Generators Evaluation” page where I added a brief description of each AI Generator under its logo to help the audience gain some insight into the background of each AI and interesting facts about them. I also had to fix some website's wrong information and design during this process. I took some time to learn how to implement my journals into GitHub. I have also met with my professor two times this week to discuss my progress and work for my internship. This amounted to 6 hours of work in total.
