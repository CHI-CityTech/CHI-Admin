### Task Summary  

This week, I worked on implementing the **Prompt 1 ranking data** from the Google Doc into the “Prompt 1 Ranking” page. Initially, I forgot to do this after my professor recommended it, as I went straight into implementing **Prompt 2 and Prompt 3 data**, overlooking the first prompt. Fixing this took **2 hours**.  

Next, I started creating a **new ranking system** since my previous one was considered too vague. My professor advised me to develop a more structured **point system** and provide in-depth evaluations of each image feature. This helped improve the accuracy of my scoring. After setting up the system, I began scoring **Grok 2 image results** and implemented the rankings into all prompt ranking pages, which took approximately **3 hours**.  

The next day, I worked on testing and recording data for **Stable Diffusion** and started ranking its images. Additionally, I edited the website to add more information and reduce large text blocks for better readability. These tasks took **4 hours**.  

The following day, I completed the **Stable Diffusion rankings** using the new point system and implemented them into each page, which took **2 hours**. Afterward, I wrote comments evaluating **Claude’s rankings**, which took **5 hours**.  

Finally, I worked on **polishing the website**, making it more visually appealing by reducing excessive text and experimenting with **background colors, fonts, emoji designs**, and generating images using **MidJourney** as well as sourcing from **Google Images**. This took **4 hours**.  

I also met with my professor **twice** this week, totaling **2 hours**.  

### **Total Time Spent: 22 hours**
